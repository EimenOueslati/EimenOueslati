### Hi there 👋 I'm Eimen

I am a student in Norway. I currently study computer science at the Norwegian university of science and technology, I am in my first year of my bachelor degree.

I have gotten into coding recently and I'm enjoying it a lot. I have started by learning C wich was not so easy to do but then I moved to python wich was much more fun to work
with. I have made some cool small project here and there but I'm still in the learning fase 😅.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a video game project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, JavaScript.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with C++, any advice or guidance will be much appreciated😁.
