### Hi there 👋 I'm Eimen

I am a student in Norway. I currently study computer science at the Norwegian university of science and technology, I am in my second year of my bachelor degree.

I have gotten into programming recently and I'm enjoying it a lot. I have started by learning C wich was not so easy to do but then I moved to python wich was much more fun to work with. I have made some cool small project here and there but I'm still in the learning fase 😅.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a video game project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++.
